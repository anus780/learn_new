<h2>DIVIDE AND CONQUER ALGORITHM</h2>
<h3>General Method:</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<p><li>In divide and conquer approach, the problem in hand,is divided into smaller sub-problems and then<u> each problem is solved  independently</u>.</li></p>

<p><li>When we keep on<b> dividing the sub problems into even smaller sub-problems</b>,we may eventually reach a stage where no more division is possible.</li></p>

<p><li>Those "atomic" smallest possible sub-problems (fractions) are solved. The solution of all sub_problems is finally merged in order to obtain the solution of an original problem</li></p>
</ul>
